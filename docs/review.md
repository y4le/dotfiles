# Dotfiles Review

Comprehensive audit of the dotfiles repo, covering bugs, staleness, dead code,
security, modernization, and structural improvements. Produced by Claude and
Codex working in parallel and then synthesized.

## Bugs (broken behavior)

These are actual runtime breakages or logic errors.

### Critical

| # | File | Line | Issue |
|---|------|------|-------|
| ~~B1~~ | ~~`scripts/bin/benchmark.sh`~~ | ~~1~~ | ~~Shebang is `#/bin/bash` — missing `!`. Script won't execute with the intended interpreter.~~ |
| ~~B2~~ | ~~`scripts/bin/benchmark.sh`~~ | ~~22~~ | ~~`[ -z cmd ]` should be `[ -z "$cmd" ]`. Always evaluates false (tests the literal string "cmd").~~ |
| ~~B3~~ | ~~`scripts/bin/benchmark.sh`~~ | ~~25~~ | ~~`return 1` at top-level in a script — should be `exit 1`. `return` only works inside functions or sourced scripts.~~ |
| ~~B4~~ | ~~`linux/.config/i3/config`~~ | ~~166~~ | ~~`Shift+Control+&mod+Right` — `&mod` is a typo for `$mod`. This keybinding silently does nothing.~~ |
| ~~B5~~ | ~~`taskwarrior/.config/zsh/sources/taskwarrior-aliases.zsh`~~ | ~~2-3~~ | ~~`return 0` followed by `echo` — the echo is unreachable dead code.~~ |
| ~~B6~~ | ~~`taskwarrior/.config/zsh/sources/taskwarrior-aliases.zsh`~~ | ~~24-25~~ | ~~Inverted retry logic: `$?` is checked after `command task "$@"` on line 22 already overwrites it. The `$? == 0` check means it retries when sync *succeeded*, not when it failed.~~ |

### High

| # | File | Line | Issue |
|---|------|------|-------|
| ~~B7~~ | ~~`alacritty/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`~~ | ~~289-295~~ | ~~Tmux shortcut key bindings send `\x02` (Ctrl-B prefix), but tmux is configured to use `C-Space` prefix. All Alacritty-tmux shortcuts are broken.~~ |
| ~~B8~~ | ~~`tmux/.tmux.conf`~~ | ~~50~~ | ~~Copy binding hardcodes `reattach-to-user-namespace cpy` — macOS-specific and will fail on Linux. Should conditionally check for the binary.~~ |
| ~~B9~~ | ~~`scripts/.funcs/cpst`~~ | ~~10-18~~ | ~~`cpy()` runs both `pbcopy` and `xclip` paths sequentially (not `elif`). On a system with both installed, input gets consumed by the first and the second gets empty stdin.~~ |
| ~~B10~~ | ~~`scripts/bin/compair.sh`~~ | ~~—~~ | ~~No shebang line. Behavior depends on whatever shell invokes it. Also uses `eval $cmd` which is fragile with special characters in filenames.~~ |
| ~~B11~~ | ~~`linux/bin/i3_switch_workspaces.sh`~~ | ~~3~~ | ~~`[ -z $@ ]` — unquoted `$@` in test. Should be `[ -z "$*" ]`.~~ |
| ~~B12~~ | ~~`linux/bin/i3_switch_workspaces.sh`~~ | ~~17~~ | ~~Calls `i3_empty_workspace.sh` which doesn't exist anywhere in the repo. (inlined logic)~~ |
| ~~B13~~ | ~~`taskwarrior/.config/taskwarrior/info/setup_taskd_client.sh`~~ | ~~1, 9~~ | ~~Declares `#!/bin/sh` but uses `[[ ]]` on line 9, which is a bashism. Will fail under dash or strict POSIX sh. (file deleted)~~ |

### Low

| # | File | Line | Issue |
|---|------|------|-------|
| ~~B14~~ | ~~`zsh/.zshrc`~~ | ~~109~~ | ~~`unalias zz` will error if the fasd oh-my-zsh plugin didn't create the alias (e.g., fasd not installed). Wrap in `(( $+aliases[zz] ))` guard.~~ |
| ~~B15~~ | ~~`zsh/.zshrc`~~ | ~~23-24~~ | ~~`a6='amd64'` and `x8='x86_64'` are hardcoded for x86. Breaks on Apple Silicon (`arm64`/`aarch64`). (removed with zplug)~~ |
| ~~B16~~ | ~~`scripts/bin/filez`~~ | ~~8-29~~ | ~~`--root` flag sets `root_file` but `fzf_sources` never uses it (only in debug output). The flag is effectively dead. (wired up)~~ |

---

## Security & Privacy

### Google-Internal Leakage

The repo was clearly migrated from a Google-internal environment. These
references should be cleaned up or moved to a gitignored local overlay:

| # | File | Line | Content |

| S13 | `.gitignore` | 1-2 | Entries for `google` and `amazon` directories — intentional, supports information isolation pattern |

### Other

| # | File | Line | Issue |
|---|------|------|-------|
| ~~S14~~ | ~~`taskwarrior/.taskrc`~~ | ~~7~~ | ~~`taskd.trust=ignore hostname` weakens TLS hostname verification~~ |
| ~~S15~~ | ~~`firefox/...userChrome.css`~~ | ~~path~~ | ~~Hardcoded Firefox profile ID `nvh7lqns.default` — machine-specific (package deleted)~~ |
| ~~S16~~ | ~~`zsh/.zshenv`~~ | ~~10~~ | ~~`BROWSER='chromium-browser'` — distro-specific, broken on macOS and many Linux distros~~ |

## Dead Code

| # | File | Line | Description |
|---|------|------|-------------|

## Modernization Opportunities

### High Value

1. ~~**zplug → zinit or sheldon** — zplug is unmaintained and slow. zinit (formerly zplugin) or sheldon (Rust) are actively maintained and faster. This is the highest-impact modernization since it affects shell startup time and plugin reliability. (done — migrated to sheldon with zsh-defer for deferred loading)~~

2. ~~**fasd → zoxide** — zoxide is a drop-in improvement: faster (Rust), actively maintained, same `z` command interface. The `zz` function in `.zshrc` can be replaced by `zi` (zoxide interactive). (done — migrated to zoxide, `zz` aliases `zi`)~~

3. ~~**Alacritty YAML → TOML** — newer Alacritty versions only support TOML. The current YAML config will stop working on upgrade. Strip the extensive comments (most are defaults) during migration. (done — alacritty package deleted)~~

4. ~~**Fix clipboard abstraction** — `cpy`/`pst` should use `elif` chains and add `wl-copy`/`wl-paste` for Wayland support. (done — `cpy`/`pst` use `elif` chains and support Wayland)~~

### Medium Value

5. ~~**exa → eza** and **youtube-dl → yt-dlp** — simple package name swaps in brew list. (done)~~

6. **vim-plug repo names** — update `scrooloose/nerdtree` → `preservim/nerdtree`, `majutsushi/tagbar` → `preservim/tagbar`, `w0rp/ale` → `dense-analysis/ale`.

7. ~~**Vim-to-FZF coupling** — `plugins.vim:75` hardcodes `~/.zplug/repos/junegunn/fzf` for the fzf runtime path. This couples vim startup to zplug's on-disk layout. Let vim-plug manage its own fzf copy, or use a system-installed fzf. (done — vim-plug manages its own fzf copy)~~

8. ~~**Neovim entrypoint** — `update_brew.sh` installs neovim, and `plugins.vim` has nvim-specific paths, but there's no `init.vim` or `init.lua`. If neovim is a target, add a proper config. If not, remove the neovim references. (done — `nvim/.config/nvim/init.vim` now sources `~/.vimrc`)~~

### Nice to Have

9. **NERDTree → oil.nvim or nvim-tree** — if migrating to neovim as primary editor.

10. **rofi config format** — rofi deprecated the old `rofi.key: value` format in favor of a rasi config file.

---

## Structural Improvements

### Setup & Bootstrap

1. ~~**Stow platform logic is inverted** — `symlinks.sh` blacklists `osx` and `taskwarrior` but does *not* blacklist `linux`. Running `./setup.sh` on macOS will stow Linux-specific files (i3, xbindkeys, xsession) into `~`. Should auto-detect platform and only stow the relevant directory, or maintain explicit allowlists per platform. (done — Makefile with explicit allowlists per platform)~~

2. ~~**Side effects in .zshenv** — `.zshenv` runs on *every* shell (including non-interactive subshells, scripts, cron). Lines 36-44 run `mkdir -p` and `npm config --global set prefix` unconditionally. These should move to `.zshrc` or a one-time setup script. (done — side-effectful npm setup was removed; `.zshenv` now only exports env and PATH)~~

3. ~~**Shell bootstrap at startup** — sheldon guard now fails fast with a message pointing to `make setup` instead of auto-installing. TPM still auto-clones on first tmux session (separate fix if desired).~~

4. ~~**Vim bootstrap at editor startup** — `vim/.vim/config/plugins.vim` still auto-downloads `plug.vim` with `curl` and runs `PlugInstall` when it is missing. That keeps first editor launch network-dependent. (done — `make vim-plugins` now installs `plug.vim`, syncs plugins explicitly, and `make setup` runs it after `make link`)~~

5. ~~**Brew lists are stale** — `update_brew.sh` includes tools that may no longer be relevant (octave, mercurial, sbcl, flow, opam). Worth pruning to reduce install time. (done — removed 16 unused packages, updated exa→eza and diff-so-fancy→delta)~~

6. ~~**Missing `asdf` config** — `update_brew.sh` installs asdf ("replaces rvm/nvm") but `.pre_profile` sets up nvm. Pick one or document the intended flow. (done — replaced with mise, removed repo bootstrap dependency on both)~~

7. ~~**README install instructions are stale** — `README.md` still tells users to run `./setup.sh`, but setup now goes through `make setup`. (done — README now points to `make setup` and `make help`)~~

### Organization

6. ~~**No CLAUDE.md** — a project-level `CLAUDE.md` would help Claude Code understand the repo structure, conventions, and local override patterns. (done — added `AGENTS.md` as agent-agnostic equivalent)~~

7. ~~**Consider a Makefile or justfile** — for discoverable setup commands (`make install`, `make link-linux`, `make link-macos`) rather than the current `setup.sh` which has limited options. (done — Makefile with setup/link/install/sheldon/clean targets)~~

8. **XDG compliance is inconsistent** — some configs use `~/.config/` (tmux, zsh themes) while others use `~/` (`.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `.taskrc`). Full XDG compliance would be a large refactor but worth noting.

- ~~Move vim-plug bootstrap out of editor startup~~
- Prune dead code and commented-out blocks
- Decide whether to keep the current Neovim shim or build a dedicated Neovim config

## Methodology

This review was produced by Claude (primary analysis — read all files, compiled
findings) and Codex (independent parallel audit — explored repo in read-only
sandbox, performed web searches on tool maintenance status). Findings were
cross-referenced and deduplicated. Areas of agreement are noted; Codex
contributed additional findings on taskwarrior bugs (B5, B6), the stow
platform logic issue, `.zshenv` side effects, the ~~vim-fzf-zplug coupling~~ (resolved),
and the benchmark.sh variable quoting bug (B2).
